Think Tank is a process improvement submission application built in SharePoint 2013.  The application is used to submit process improvement ideas.
  
The front end provides links to the submission forms, pre-built reports and uses jQuery tabs to present embedded Excel web part charts to show reporting which is gathered from the data submitted.
